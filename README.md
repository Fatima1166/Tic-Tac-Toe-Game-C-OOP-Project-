# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-C-OOP-Project-

Project Title: Tic Tac Toe Game
Language: C++
Project Type: Console-based Game
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Course: Programming Fundamentals / OOP

 Project Overview:
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a classic 2-player console game built using Object-Oriented Programming in C++. The program allows two players to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. This project demonstrates basic OOP concepts like classes, objects, encapsulation, and methods.

 Key Features:
3x3 Tic Tac Toe board display
Two-player turn-based gameplay
Input validation (e.g., checking for occupied cells)
Win condition checker (row, column, diagonal)
Draw checker
Option to restart or exit the game

OOP Concepts Used:
Class: A TicTacToe class to handle game logic

Objects: Create game object in main()
Encapsulation: Private data members for board & methods
Member Functions: For board display, input, checking winner, etc.
(Optional) Overloading, constructors, etc
